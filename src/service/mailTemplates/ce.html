    <<Please complete your SpareRoom registration>>

    Hi Patrik,

    Thank you for registering with SpareRoom

    Please confirm your email address
    So that we know that you have entered your email address correctly, we need you to go to http://spareroom.co.uk/el/1133421079/569d1653ea1a29f6/ to confirm your email address. This will fully activate your membership and allow your messages to go through the website.

    Why do I need to do this?
    The reason we need to do this is that some users enter their email in incorrectly, which results in bounced messages, both from us and from other users trying to contact them. To make the site more useful for everyone, we like to make sure that all information is correct and up-to-date.

    Remember our listings change constantly so don’t forget to keep checking back.
    Whether you’re trying to rent your spare room out, or if you’re trying to find a room for yourself, we wish you the best of luck!

    Kind regards,

    The SpareRoom Team
